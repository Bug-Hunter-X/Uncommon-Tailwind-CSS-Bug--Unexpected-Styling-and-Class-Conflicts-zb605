# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bug: Unexpected Styling and Class Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where combining certain utility classes leads to unexpected visual results or conflicts.  The problem stems from the order of classes or the interaction of classes that unintentionally override each other. This usually occurs when there are too many classes used. 

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when applying multiple Tailwind CSS classes to an element, causing unintended visual effects or overwriting of styles. The main culprit is incorrect class order or class combinations that produce unexpected behavior. The exact nature of the problem might vary depending on the involved utility classes and their order of appearance within the class attribute. 

## Bug Solution

The solution involves careful review of class combinations and order. Using Tailwind's developer tools to inspect the resulting CSS can greatly assist in identifying what styles are applied and resolve the conflicts.
